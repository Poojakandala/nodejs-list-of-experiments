                    Dr.Lavu Rathaiah took an initiative to begin Vignan Institute of Technology and Science in the year 1999
                        with an idea to bridge the gap between the industry needs and the engineers who serve the purpose and 
                        against all the odds he and his team stood strong developing the institute with 4 branches of engineering 
                        to an organization with different graduation and post-graduation courses. Vignan evolved as a diverse and 
                        dynamic community with 2500 students. Vignan engineering colleges in Hyderabad.</center>
